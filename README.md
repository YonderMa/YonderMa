-👋 Hello,everyone this is @YonderMa，currently I'm major in biomedical engineering,which comprises many electron courses,and I do think computer science skills are not only a usable tool for my major,but a valuable domain that can be used and explored in any aspect of our daily life.
-👀 I'm interested in the Interdisciplinary Studies over Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence,Data Technology and Electronic Engineering.I'm sorry that I've just newly get contacted with the Computer Science so that I'm lack of much CS knowledge as a initial learner.
-🌱 At present,I'm studying the basic skills of C++ coding.
-💞️ Condition permitting,I hope you can share me some suggestions and study resources like tutorials,
competition platform,and so on.
